# SomeoneElse-style-legend
A manually-curated legend for SomeoneElse-style and OpenStreetMap-carto-AJT

Files are maintained as .osm files, and are designed to be appended into
a database rendering this style.

The "location" of the data for this file is in the middle of Australia.
It's designed to be somewhere "not on the map" that no-one would go to by
accident.  If you want to render Australia with this style, you'd want to
move this data somewhere else - just change the co-ordinates from -24 and 135
to something else.
